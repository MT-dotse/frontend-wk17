# Netflix titles API frontend ðŸŽ¥

I have built my first API using Node in Express and a frontend to show the results. It has been a fun and insightful experience going through the whole process, from backend to frontend.

You can view my app live here: https://mt-dotse-netflix-titles.netlify.app/

Repo for the Backend API: https://github.com/MT-dotse/project-express-api

API is live in Heroku here: https://mtdose-netflix-shows.herokuapp.com/
